General structure:

Class Cell:
	variables:	
		list of neighbors (Cells)
		tuple of x,y position (int,int)
		tuple with states (old/new)
		pointer to state

	methods:
		stay_alive(list of neighbors, state) -> True/False

main:
	variables:	
		2D array with Cells (index = position)
		dim=(width,length)

	methods:
		initialize_cells (width,length) -> 2d array with cells	
		initialize_neighbors (2d list with Cells) -> void
		update (2d list with Cells) -> void
		output() -> void
